"""
Tic-Tac-Toe Game
---------------
This program implements a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player competes 
against an AI opponent.

Board Representation:
    The board is a list of 9 integers:
        - 10   ? First Player's move (X)
        - -10  ? Second Player's move (O)
        - 1-9  ? Unclaimed squares (used for display and input)

Scoring:
    - First Player win  ? +30
    - Second Player win ? -30
    - Tie               ? 0

Imported Functions:
    - print_board(board): Displays the board in a human-friendly format.
    - game_over(board): Returns True if the game has a winner or no moves remain.
    - calc_score(board): Returns 30 if first player wins, -30 if second player wins, else 0.
    - player_move(board, score): Prompts the player for a move and updates the board.
    - ai_move(board): Chooses a random available move (used in easy mode).
    - find_move(board, playerTurn): Uses minimax to find the best AI move (hard mode).
    - clear_screen(): Clears the terminal for a cleaner display.
